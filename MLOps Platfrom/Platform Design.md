# Plattform Design


Cloud-Native: CNCF

- build and run scalable applications -> required for ML learning
- relies on:
	- Containers
	- Service Mesh
	- Microservices
	- Immutable infrastructure 
	- declarative API
- results in:
	- loosely coupled systems
	- resilient 
	- manageable 
	- observable
	- robust automation
	- frequently high-impact changes


Platform: 

- goal holistic machine learning platform with MLOps capabilities

- derive components from the general ML requirements and identified MLOps capabilities and combine them into a single platform

General ML Requirements: 
	- orchestration component: manages the components on the platform
	- scheduler: move workloads to machines
	- environment runtime: encloses and manages the lifecycle of an application


Stellt: 
	- Resource Provisioning (CPU, GPU, Storage, Network)
	- Execution Environments (Components, Deployed Model, Deployed ML Pipeline) & Development Environments
	- Components
